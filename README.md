First Repository
Hello, my name's Matt.  I currently only know Java, and a little Python, but I am
a curious individual and will be putting all of my projects on here to get some input.
I hope to make my own website someday that will better lay out my intentions for future
projects as well as all of my completed works.  If you're reading this, then I hope you
will take some time to look at my projects and possibly join in on the fun.  Any 
comments/critizisms are welcome!
